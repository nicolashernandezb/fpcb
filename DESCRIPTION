Description: Functions to represent functional objects under a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework as described 
  in Muñoz & González (2010). Autoregressive Hilbertian Model for functional time series using RKHS and predictive confidence bands construction 
  as proposed in Hernández et al (2021).
